GM Comments:

- These changes will allow Dark Priests to deal 25% of a boss's health over 25 seconds and 50% of a normal mob's health. The cooldown remains at two minutes, as this spell is now an excellent way for priests to assist in dealing consistent damage to help bashers handle mobs. We will continue monitoring this spell and may merge it with Quake/Vortex due to their similar concepts.
