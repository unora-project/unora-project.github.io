[General]

- 🛡️ Fixed an issue with front and back damage.

- 🧮 Small change in the way aislings accrue aggro on monsters:

- The new formula is as follows:
    - Aggro = Stored Aggro + (damage * Base Class Multiplier)
        - Stored Aggro: The damage and aggro you've already accrued.
        - Damage: The current damage you are applying to the monster.

- Updated Base Class Multipliers:
    - ✝️ Priest: 1.4
    - 🥋 Monk: 4.0
    - 🗡️ Rogue: 1.6
    - ⚔️ Warrior: 1.2
    - 🧙 Wizard: 1.8
