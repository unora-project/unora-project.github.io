# Fishing

Fishing is a secondary profession in Unora that is able to be learned by all aislings.

## Where to learn

Head to the Fishing Market in Abel (27,46) and speak to Kamel.

## How to fish

Upon learning fishing, purchase a Basic Fishing Pole for 1,000 gold and some Fishing Bait for 100 gold each. Each fishing attempt uses up 1 bait regardless of if you caught a fish or not. Fishing Poles do not have durability, so you do not need to worry about them breaking on you. With your fishing pole equipped, stand next to a fishing area until you see a blinking question mark over your head. Wait a few seconds to make sure it stays there, and then you're fishing!

Fishing is an idle profession where you're expected to set it up and step away from Unora.

## Where to fish

There are several popular areas, but people tend to fish within towns. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

- Abel, down by the boat area (33,62)
- Mileth, on the bridge to the Wilderness (54,9)

## Benefits

Here are some reasons why you would want to fish:

- Sell them for Gold
- Used for various quests
- Can be traded to the Piet alchemist for monster extracts
    - Aislings that know the Alchemy profession can use these extracts to craft all kinds of potions
- Gives you a legend mark: Caught a fish (<number_of_fish>)
- Each fish you catch provides a bit of experience (so, passive AFK leveling)
    - Useless boots you catch do not provide experience

## Fish list

As it stands, all fish can be caught at any fishing spot; no fish has an exclusive spot it must be caught in.

This is a non-exhaustive list and will be added to as more fish are known.
