# Foraging

Foraging is a secondary profession in Unora that is able to be learned by all aislings.

## Where to learn

Head to the Suomi Cherry Farmer in Suomi (17,72) and speak to Goran.

## How to forage

Upon learning foraging, purchase a Cloth Glove from Goran for 50,000 gold. With the glove equipped, stand by a qualifying bush until you see a question mark blinking above your head (you'll also see a buff come up). Once the buff is visible, you're foraging! This is intended to be an idle profession to give you something to passively gather while you're away from the game.
