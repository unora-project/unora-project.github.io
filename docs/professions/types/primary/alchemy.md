# Alchemy

The alchemy profession can be used to create potions which grant temporary benefits during battle. The alchemy lab is located in the house at (18,35) in Piet Village and taught by the mundane Mathis. Mathis also sells Empty Bottles for crafting potions, and will buy any potions you create. The mundane Paracelsus will give you various types of Monster Extract in exchange for monster parts, and will also buy most types of items in Temuair for a cheap amount of gold. The mundane Luna will trade various types of flowers for a large amount of gold.
