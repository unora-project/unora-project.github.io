# Jewelcrafting

The Jewelcrafting profession can be used to craft various rings, necklaces, and earrings. The Jewelcrafting building is located in the house at (20,10) in Rucesion and taught by the mundane Celestia. Celestia will also buy any crafted items for a reasonable price.

Jewelcrafting recipes use Gems which can be hunted from the Grimlocks in the two different Pravat Caves in the Wilderness, or from Kobolds and Goblins in Eastern Woodlands, Western Woodlands, and the Wilderness. Aislings of any profession can polish the Gems in the Jewelcrafting building. There's a separate polishing success rate for each type of Gem: Ruby, Saphire, Emerald, Beryl, Heartstone, and for each quality of Gem: Raw, Flawed, Uncut, Pristine.

Jewelcrafting also uses various types of Raw and Polished Ores, which can be found from various hunting areas: Bronze, Iron, Mythril, Hy-Brasyl, Crimsonite, and Azurium.
