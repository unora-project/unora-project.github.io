# Enchanting

The Enchanting profession can be used to add various stats to individual pieces of equipment. The Enchanting building is located in the house at (45,39) in Undine Village and taught by the mundane Elara. The mundane Aria will trade any type of Essence for any other type of Essence for a fee of 2,000 gold per trade. A successful crafting of an enchantment will create a scroll which can be traded and applied to an unequipped piece of gear. Each enchantment has a level, and can only be applied to gear of the same or higher level.

Each rank of enchantment requires a specific number of Essence from the same God as the enchant you want to craft:
