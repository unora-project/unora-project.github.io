!!! tip

    Red Potion (or "Health Potion") is made from an Apple, a Passion Flower and an Empty Bottle.

    - Apples can be found from monsters in Mileth Crypt 1
    - Passion Flowers are found randomly through Unora or exchanged in the Piet Alchemy Lab (18,35)
    - Empty Bottles can be purchased by Mathis in the Piet Alchemy Lab (18,35)

    Find another player who's taken the Alchemist profession and ask them to craft one for you with these materials. If they ask, it's the regular Health Potion, not the small one!

- Return to Bertil with the Red Potion ("Health Potion") to complete the quest
