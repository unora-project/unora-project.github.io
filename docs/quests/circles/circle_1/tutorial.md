Riona asks you to get a stick from Callo, the weaponsmith in Mileth. Once you've found a stick, come back and see Riona.

- Head to Callo, the weaponsmith (5,38)
- Speak to Callo
- Select "Spare a Stick"
- Select "I'll gather them now."

Callo asks you to collect 6 branches outside to craft you a stick and a wooden shield. Walk outside of Mileth around the trees and pick up 6 branches.

!!! tip

    Walk around outside of the armorsmith (13,24 area). You will eventually see a yellow message in your chat that says "Oh, you've found a sturdy branch! That makes X branches!" Once you've picked up a branch, what you've located is called a "reactor tile". This means that the spot where you picked up the branch reacted to you walking on it, triggering you to pick up the stick. Reactor tiles don't always have a 100% chance to trigger. In this branch retrieval quest, once you find the tile, if you walk off of it and back on it several times, you will retrieve all of the branches pretty quickly. Throughout Unora, there are reactor tiles for various triggers in game, and not all of them will stick around after you've triggered them, but this one does..

- Once you have collected 6 branches, head back to Callo
- Select "Spare a Stick"
- Click "Next"
- Select "I have those branches. Here!"

Callo crafts you a stick and a wooden shield.

- Head back to Riona at the Mileth Inn (19,13)
- Speak to Riona
- Select "I got a stick"
- Select "I am ready!"

Riona has you set off to pick your class at the Temple of Choosing.

Here, 5 class avatars stand and will teach you the way of their profession. Read up on the available [classes](../../../classes/peasant.md) and/or speak to each avatar to understand what each class does. When ready, speak to the avatar you're interested in and click "Dedicate X Class".

- With your class chosen, head back to Riona and speak to her
- Select "I picked my class."
- Select "I will speak to him."

Riona requests you to speak to Skarn in front of the Mileth Crypt. He's been keeping the crypt's population under control for a while and could use your help.

- Speak to Skarn (58,25)
