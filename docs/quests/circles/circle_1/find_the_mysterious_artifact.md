## Walkthrough

### Part 1: Find the Mysterious Artifact

!!! note ""

To start this quest, you must come across an item called a "Mysterious Artifact". This item is found randomly, but can be found walking around in Mileth Crypt (floors 3 and 4) or East Woodlands Path 2+. There are other zones as well, but have been where I've found them.

Once you have the Mysterious Artifact, to proceed, you must be level 41+ and must join a [religion](../../../religion/overview.md). Once you've joined one:

!!! note ""

- Speak to the goddess that you're worshipping
- Select "Mysterious Artifact"
- Select "Take me there"
- You are teleported to the God's realm
- First, speak with Goddess Miraelis
- Select "I spoke to Zephyr"
- Select "Ignatar was helped by a summoner"
- Select "The summoner disappeared once the war started"

- Select "Is there something I can do?"
- Select "How do I get around the barrier?"
- Select "Where do I find the Elemental Artifacts?"
- Select "What about the other artifacts?"
- Select "Thank you Goddess"
- You can choose to stay here or chat with the other Goddesses, although they have nothing useful to say at the moment

!!! info ""

Miraelis explains that the summoner that helped Ignatar is pinned up on the 3rd floor of Eingren Manor and has protected the floor with a barrier. To get around the barrier, you must assemble the True Elemental Artifact. To do this, you must collect four artifacts and bring them to the Goddesses, which, with the other Goddess's help, Miraelis would be able to assemble.

The first artifact, the Earth Artifact, is held by the Earth Guardian in West Woodlands. She asks you to find this artifact first. Once found, the other Goddesses will assist with the other artifacts. You give Miraelis the Mysterious Artifact that you found so she can have it studied for anomalies.

### Part 2: Elemental Guardians

??? info "Quest name does not match in-game"

### Part 3: The Goddess' Trials

!!! note

    This portion of the quest **must** be done solo.

#### Trial of Combat

??? info "Level considerations"

    Although this quest can be done as early as 71, it will be very tough for non-99's to complete. It's completely OK to wait until 99 before attempting these trials, but you're more than welcome to try!

- Select "What are the other trials?"
- Select "I can handle it."

!!! danger ":material-sword-cross: Combat incoming!"

- When you are ready to face the trials, select "I am ready."

!!! note ""

Before sending you to fight the summoner, the gods have designed four trials you must overcome _yourself_. The trial of combat, the trial of luck, the trial of intelligence and the trial of sacrifice. In the event you fail a trial, you can retry every real life hour.

!!! note ""

You have 10 minutes to defeat five waves of monsters:

- Hobgoblins
- Crypt Kardis
- Orc Warriors
- Gargoyles
- Slugs, Glupes, Bone Collectors

Monsters will spawn all around the arena. In order for you to proceed to the next wave, all monsters must be defeated.

- Once victorious, speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will go speak to Serendael."

!!! info ""

Miraelis is impressed with how you handled yourself in combat and states that's what they're looking for. She directs you next to the trial of luck.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Luck

- Speak to Serendael
- Select "Is there any tips to pass?"
- Select "I will try."

The trial of luck consists of 3 rounds of picking the correct door. Wrong doors will teleport you back to the beginning and right ones will allow you to progress. This trial is purely luck-based; you will have 1 minute to complete it.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    You will spawn into a hallway and must run forward until you see 3 doors spawn. Choose any door. If the door is correct, you'll see text in the communication window that says "The door opens and lets you through." If the door is incorrect, you will see "The door locks and sends you flying." If you get the first round correct, there are 5 doors on the second round and 8 doors on the third. If you get the door wrong, the door that was correct before will not be correct the second time. Every round is purely random. Just mount up and keep clicking doors until you get through.

- Upon completion, speak to Serendael
- Select "I will go speak to Theselene."

!!! info ""

Serendael compliments your luckiness and lets you know that luck is needed when facing the Summoner. She tells you to speak with Goddess Theselene to take on the trial of intelligence.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Intelligence

- Speak to Theselene
- Select "Do you have any advice?"
- Select "I understand."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of intelligence consists of an invisible maze. You must map out the maze to navigate through it. You get 5 tries before you are reset to the beginning, however it will not reset your progress in the maze. You have 8 minutes to complete the trial.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    Drop denominations of 1 gold on the ground to remember where you're going. Not every path you take will lead to the end of the maze. If you notice that the path you went down has no more choices, try a different starting point at the beginning and see where it takes you.

- With the maze solved, speak to Theselene
- Select "I will go speak to Skandara."

!!! info ""

Theselene says that shadows quake in fear of you; the sheer intelligence you behold shows. She advises you to speak with Skandara for the final trial, the trial of sacrifice.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Sacrifice

- Speak to Skandara
- Select "What are your words of wisdom?"
- Select "I know."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of sacrifice creates an environment where you will need to show that you have what it takes to risk it all. There will be 5 waves of monsters and Zoe will be their target. You must protect Zoe throughout the trial. You have 20 minutes to complete the trial.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    This trial starts with a little girl named Helpless Zoe in the middle of an arena. Waves of monsters will spawn and directly target Zoe. You will need to fend them off to keep Zoe from taking damage. She has a large health pool and can tank monsters for a bit.

    On the last wave, a dragon will spawn and start speaking. After about 10 seconds, the dragon will breathe a large frontal in front of him. Your need to position yourself directly in front of the dragon with Zoe behind you to shield her from the dragon's blast. This will complete the trial.

- With Zoe safe, speak to Skandara
- Select "That blast hurt..."
- Select "I will do that."

!!! info ""

Skandara is impressed, even though the hydra knocked you out; that's what a soldier is all about. Zoe is safe and the hydra took after he realized he was too weak. She congratulates you and tells you to speak with Goddess Miraelis.

!!! info ""

#### Back to Miraelis

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will be on my way there."
- Select "I'll bring a party, thank you."

!!! info ""

Miraelis shares that they have verified the location of the Summoner within the third floor of Eingren Manor. You will need the True Elemental Artifact to break the seal on the stairs. She mentions that the summoner isn't alone; there are multiple other bosses lurking around on the third floor. You will need a party to venture through there. Miraelis then hands you the True Elemental Artifact.

!!! info ""

### Part 4: Search for the Summoner

!!! warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

??? tip "Group comp!"

    If doing this with a fresh 99 party, you are going to want a balanced group of a Priest, DPS and possibly a tank. If an experienced master is coming along with you, they will likely be able to solo the dragon.

- With the True Elemental Artifact, head to Eingren Manor with a party and go upstairs to 14,1
- Select "We are ready."

??? info "Boss locations"

    The third floor of Eingren Manor is huge with two extra bosses and then the summoner himself.

    Here are the locations to the two optional bosses and the summoner:

    - Possessed Knight (11,23)
    - Hollow (145,20)
    - Summoner Kades (28,185)

- (Optional) Defeat the side bosses
- Once ready, head to Summoner Kades
- Upon encountering him, he will display some dialogue:

> You are very bold Aislings. Coming into my home... This world is mine now. Return to which you came. I have other things to tend to, Servant! Get them!

- Kades will then summon his Servant, Morroc, and escape. Morroc explains during the fight:

> Nothing will stop master from summoning them! He will rule the world with the creants! Master is going to Cthonic Remains! He will rule the world with the creants!

!!! tip

    Unless you can take a hit, do not stand in front of Morroc! He has a strong fire frontal that will do massive damage to you.

Once Morroc has been slain, a portal will open that will take you back to the entrance at Eingren Manor. The True Elemental Artifact will have been consumed during this process.

- Head back to the God's Realm through your chosen Goddess temple
- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "He said the Summoner went to the Cthonic Remains"
- Select "Ok, I will wait."
- Select "How strong should I be?"

!!! info ""

Miraelis mentions she will begin an investigation into what Morroc mentioned about the Summoner heading to the Cthonic Remains before having you go look yourself. She asks you to wait until the goddesses have more information.

!!! info ""

- Speak to Miraelis again
- Select "What are Creants?"
- Select "Why are they so powerful?"
- Select "Why didn't you stop them?"
- Select "That's why Summoner Kades is down there."
- Select "How strong should I be?"
- Select "I will try."

!!! info ""

Miraelis believes that Summoner Kades is headed to the Cthonic Remains to summon the creants. The Creants are mystical creatures that the Goddesses have spent centuries sealing away, too powerful to ever be killed. They represent four of the elements:

!!! info ""

- Lady Phoenix, who has captured the wind
- Tauren, who has captured the earth
- Shamensyth, who controls fire
- Medusa, who dominates the flow of water

!!! info ""

Shortly after the Goddesses created elements in Unora, these Creants came and used them for evil. Killing these Creants would be as difficult as killing the elements they created themselves; with the elements being a part of the goddesses themselves, they couldn't do it. Instead, one by one, they sealed the Creants away deep beneath the Cthonic Remains. It was done so long ago, the goddesses weren't sure anyone even knew about them until now. She mentions you must go down there and slay Summoner Kades for good this time, but you will need to be much stronger this time around.

!!! info ""

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need at least 20,000 vitality before facing Summoner Kades again._

### Part 5: Find the Summoner again

??? warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

    You will need a party (with a Priest!) for this part.

#### To Cthonic Remains

- Once you have 20,000 vitality, return to Miraelis in the God's Realm and speak to her
- She will request for you to investigate the Cthonic Remains and find the summoner
- Head to Cthonic Remains 11

??? tip "CR Coordinates"

    Here's a quick guide on where to go inside:

    - CR1 -> CR2: 74,45
    - CR2 -> CR3: 51,38
    - CR3 -> CR4: 38,64
    - CR4 -> CR5: 27,23
    - CR5 -> CR6: 4,31
    - CR6 -> CR7: 14,29
    - CR7 -> CR8: 47,53
    - CR8 -> CR9: 75,45
    - CR9 -> CR10: 60,15
    - CR10 -> CR11: 84,6

!!! danger ":material-emoticon-devil-outline: Boss room ahead!"

- Once inside, enter the broken wall at 1,39
- Select "We are ready."
- You will be teleported to the Cthonic Domain, where Summoner Kades resides

#### Second battle with the Summoner

Summoner Kades will cast magic on your party to cage you in place. He'll start muttering in another language:

!!! info ""

> Ta se deas duit teacht chun feachaint. Glacfaimid Unora le cheile, na Creants agus me fein. Is anois ar n-am! Lean mise isteach sa dorchadas. Eirigh, a chara dhil, Tauren, Eilimint an Domhain. Tar anuas go Unora, Lady Phoenix, Eilimint an Ghao... Rugadh as na lasracha, Shamensyth, Eilimint an Doi... Ri na Farraige, Medusa, Eilimint an Uisce. Teigh abhaile. Caithfidh me na triobloidi seo a mh...

If you check the yellow chat log, you'll see a translated version of what Summoner Kades is saying (I missed some of this due to the messages being too long, but here is a truncated version):

> It is nice of you to come watch. The Creants and I will take Unora together. Now is our time! Follow me into the darkness. Now is our time! Follow me into the darkness. Rise, my dear friend, Tauren. [truncated] Come down to Unora, Lady Phoenix. [truncated] Born of the flames, Shamensyth. [truncated] Queen of the Sea, Medusa. Return home. I must kill these [truncated]. My friends have returned to the world. You have been following me, it is time to perish.

!!! info ""

Summoner Kades will then turn hostile, remove your cage and start attacking your party.

- After some damage, he will portal away. Chase him into the portal
- You will arrive in Terra Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Terra Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in the Gale Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Gale Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in the Tide Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Tide Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in Ignis Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Ignis Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- Attack Kades. He will summon one of each guardian's element in a final fight for his life. Defeat the guardians and Kades to finish the battle

Return to the God's Realm.

#### Back to the God's Realm

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "No, Kades ported them away."
- Select "We fought Summoner Kades."
- Select "He just vanished at the end."
- Select "What can I do?"
- Select "Yes Goddess Miraelis."

!!! info ""

You brief Miraelis on the fight with Summoner Kades and the Creants taking portals into Unora. Miraelis is worried and found it too soon to send you out on this journey. She asks you to continue your training and see her again once you master.

!!! info ""

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need to be a Master of your class._

### Part 6: Defeat the Dark Army

- Return to Miraelis and speak to her

!!! info ""

Miraelis mentions that Summoner Kade left a dark army behind and you must defeat them all.

!!! info ""

!!! warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

This section is what is commonly referred to as "Master Dungeon". This quest feels poorly put together in game and doesn't offer much guidance on what to do, but this guide will cover all of the Master Dungeon aspects.

- To start, head to House Macabre
- If you have never completed Master Dungeon before, you must run all the way down to CR-21
    - You will not be able to take the shortcut portal to CR-21 until you complete it once
    - You _can_ open a portal to CR11 by speaking to Hazel at 1,4 for 250,000 gold
- If you have completed Master Dungeon before, you can opt to teleport directly to CR-21
    - To do this, speak to Hazel at 1,4
    - Select "Open Portal CR21"
    - For 400,000 gold, you can open a portal that will teleport your entire party
- Once at CR-21, walk through the crack in the wall to enter the Cthonic Demise [need coordinates]

Master Dungeon is set up to where there are two fixed bosses: a hydra and a dinosaur. Defeating these bosses drops a summoning bell. You want to collect both summoning bells from each boss first. **Do not double-click the bells until you are ready!**

There are specific spots to use the summoning bell with each spot summoning a boss of a specific class. In order to obtain your Master Dungeon skills/spells, **you must defeat both summoned class bosses that are the same class as you.** Defeating two class bosses will complete your Master Dungeon run and open a portal to teleport you back to CR-11.

Here's a helpful map to show where everything is:

![Master Dungeon Map](./assets/master_dungeon.png)

To interpret this, "BOSS 1" and "BOSS 2" hold the summoning bells you need to summon the class bosses and each class boss is listed on the map. Use the summoning bells on the class boss spots to summon them.

Each class boss has a name:

- Warriors: John, Jane
- Monks: Mike, Mary
- Rogues: Roy, Ray
- Priest: Phil, Pam
- Wizard: William, Wanda

Once you have defeated both class bosses, take the portal to complete Master Dungeon. Master Dungeon has a 4 hour cooldown period before you can run it again. In order to complete the quest, you must defeat all 10 class bosses. If you aren't sure which bosses you've yet defeated, return to the God Realm and speak to Miraelis. She will tell you which ones you've defeated by name. Use the list above to figure out which bosses you have left.

- Once you've defeated all 10, return to Miraelis and speak to her
- Select "Thank you, they are very useful."

!!! info ""

Miraelis compliments your new master skills and tells you that you're a true master. She tells you to come back once you are ready to face the Creants.

!!! info ""

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need to have 60,000 total raw vitality._

### Part 7: The Creants

To get started, speak to Miraelis. She will tell you that she thinks you're ready to challenge the Creants and seal them away with your newfound abilities. She shares the location of each of the Creants with you:

- Lady Phoenix: Shinewood Forest
- Medusa: Oren Ruins
- Tauren: Mount Giragan
- Shamensyth: Nobis Sewers

There is no order in which you need to challenge the Creants, however, you may find one easier than the others. You tell Miraelis that you understand and are also notified that in order to survive the Creants, you need at least 25,000 HP. ((This isn't a requirement, but a note that this will make the fights more comfortable for both you and your healer.))

Personally, from easiest to most difficult, I would put them in this order: Tauren > Lady Phoenix > Medusa > Shamensyth.

Defeating each creant rewards you with either a piece of your Grand Master gear or your Grand Master spells/skills.

??? tip "Offenses and Defenses!"

    Each creant has a different defense and attack element. It is _required_ that you grab a belt that counters each Creant's element and that you wear them when fighting them. For the maximum damage, you should also wear the appropriate elemental necklace for damage. The appropriate counter element will deal more damage than a dark necklace, so don't be lazy.

    Belts:

    - Mileth armorsmith: Fire belt
    - Undine armorsmith: Sea belt
    - Rucesion armorsmith: Wind belt
    - Piet armorsmith: Earth belt

    Necklaces:

    - Carlos, the Rucesion armorsmith, sells Wind, Sea, Fire and Earth necklaces

#### Lady Phoenix

- To find Lady Phoenix, head to the back of Shinewood Forest in Shinewood Forest 18

??? tip "Lady Phoenix strategy"

    **Belt:** Wind; **Necklace:** Fire

    Lady Phoenix's mechanic is that she summons dangerous tornadoes that must be avoided at all costs. Standing in them will deal massive draining damage to you. Additionally, she is very fast and will constantly switch targets. You cannot outrun her and must stand still facing her if you're targeted to reduce the amount of damage taken. This is a very healing-intensive fight - especially when a target with low HP is chosen.

    The group should try to stay close together and find safe spots away from the tornadoes in order to avoid being hit by them. It is not worth dealing damage to the tornadoes; simply run away from them.

    Lady Phoenix will frequently cast Hail of Feathers for group-wide AoE damage, which must be healed through. She will also teleport away for a few seconds, giving the party a little break (to relocate from the tornadoes maybe?) before re-appearing and picking a new target.

    Rinse and repeat these mechanics to defeat Lady Phoenix.

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPOHzXWGem4?si=crSazyo0AGar_4RS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Once your party is ready, approach the altar and select "We are ready."
- Defeat Lady Phoenix


#### Medusa

- To find Medusa, head to Nobis (28,1) and enter the Oren Ruins
- Go through the right door in the ruins maze and get to 3-5 (named: Oren Ruins Altar)

??? tip "Medusa strategy"

    **Belt:** Sea; **Necklace:** Earth

    Medusa has a mechanic where if anyone (but the tank) faces her front, they will turned to stone. Before getting started, turn group loot off for this fight. This fight drops Warmth Potions, which will be needed in case someone turns to stone.

    When the fight starts, your healer and Wizard should be positioned at the south-easternmost portion of the altar. This is to avoid the water waves that are summoned frequently throughout the fight that will likely kill them in one hit. This also gives the Wizard added visibility to the arena, which will be explained later. The tank will tank the boss at the northernmost part of the arena by the altar/candles. Melee DPS will initially be at her rear and sides.

    When the fight starts and Medusa spawns, make sure that only the tank is facing Medusa directly. All DPS classes will focus the boss. As the fight progresses, snake nests will spawn on the outsides of the altar. It is up to either 1 or 2 bashers to hunt these nests down as they will constantly summon snakes. It's primarily the Wizard's job to kill the snakes throughout the fight so they do not make their way to the altar and kill your healer. They can be dall'd to stop them from moving so you have time to kill them.

    During combat, Medusa will transition frequently between the altar and the middle of the room. While she's in the middle of the room, you should stay on the altar as she will summon geysers that deal heavy damage if you step on them. This is especially important for the people killing the snake nests.

    Snakes will occasionally drop Warmth Potions, which should be picked up and used on anyone that has turned to stone. You should call out if you have been turned to stone. A member of your party will need to loot the potion, walk next to you and physically use the potion while facing you to remove the stone effect from you.

    At a certain phase of the fight (seems like 50%?), she will teleport to the middle of the room and several tiles will start blinking light blue on the altar. The entire party has about 12~ seconds to move onto the blinking tiles. All other tiles will explode after the time limit, killing anyone that wasn't on the blinking ones.

    Rinse and repeat these mechanics to defeat Medusa.

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ona4UBDi1Rw?si=mg2FstnRlPOi3hpl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Once your party is ready, approach the altar and select "We are ready."
- Defeat Medusa

#### Tauren

- To find Tauren, head to Mount Giragan and go to Mount Giragan 3
- In the top-left corner of the map is the entrance to the Giragan Caves
- In the back of the caves is where Tauren resides

??? tip "Tauren strategy"

    **Belt:** Earth; **Necklace:** Wind

    When the fight starts, the tank will pick up the boss and DPS will focus damage. Tauren will constantly summon ice crystals at the furthest person from him, dealing damage. This is typically the healer's role to kite these around the room so DPS can focus on damage.

    As the fight progresses, blinking light blue tiles will become visible. Everyone in the group must stand on a blinking tile in order to avoid room wide damage that will one shot you otherwise.

    As Tauren gets weaker, he will start slamming his axe into the ground in front of him, dealing high damage in a 4x4 grid. Only the tank should be taking this damage while others should steer clear.

    Rinse and repeat these mechanics to defeat Tauren.

??? tip "Shamensyth strategy"

    **Belt:** Fire; **Necklace:** Water

    Shamensyth's main mechanic lies on the Wizard(s) in your party to put out flames that spawn throughout the arena with their Sal spells (Mor Sal Lamh, Tidal Wave and Tidal Breeze if pure). The flames to put out are not targetable and must have AoE applied to them. They deal massive damage while standing in them and if Shamensyth, or his illusions stand in them, he is healed health. The Wizard will spend almost the entire time running around the arena trying to make sure the arena is not covered in flames.

    Before starting the fight, the healer and three other DPS must stand at each pillar. Drop a coin by the pillar as this will help aid you in where the illusions will drop. The Wizard should prioritize making sure the flames are never on these coins. Once the fight starts, the coins will be despawned and the DPS will need to drop a coin in the exact spot it was before. The first coin drop is just to aid the party where they will need to drop theirs. The tank will stand around the middle of the arena, tanking Shamensyth.

    DPS will stay put at their respective pillars the entire fight. When an illusion spawns at a coin, it is up to the DPS at the pillar to quickly defeat the illusion.

    Throughout the fight, small fire elementals will spawn that must be killed. The tank will primarily be responsible for killing them. The DPS can quickly step away from their coin to come help if the fire elementals are close enough to their coin, but they must quickly return to their coin once they have been dealt with. Adds should be prioritized over the boss as if the adds get out of control, your party will surely wipe due to the amount of damage going out.

    Shamensyth will teleport to the middle of the room occasionally and blinking light blue tiles will be visible. Your party will need to quickly stand on any of the blinking tiles. You have about 12~ seconds before the cast goes off, performing a room-wide AoE that will instantly kill anyone that isn't on a safe tile. The pattern for these safe tiles will change towards the end of the fight, having the blinking tiles connected inwards to each pillar, creating a plus sign.

    Rinse and repeat these mechanics to defeat Shamensyth.
