## Walkthrough

### Part 1: Find the Mysterious Artifact

!!! note ""

To start this quest, you must come across an item called a "Mysterious Artifact". This item is found randomly, but can be found walking around in the Mileth Crypt floors. It's been reported this can be found on floors 3 and 4.

Once you have the Mysterious Artifact, to proceed, you must join a [religion](./../../../religion/overview.md). Once you've joined one:

!!! note ""

- Select "Mysterious Artifact"
- Select "Take me there"

!!! info ""

Miraelis explains that the summoner that helped Ignatar is pinned up on the 3rd floor of Eingren Manor and has protected the floor with a barrier. To get around the barrier, you must assemble the True Elemental Artifact. To do this, you must collect four artifacts and bring them to the Goddesses, which, with the other Goddess's help, Miraelis would be able to assemble.

The first artifact, the Earth Artifact, is held by the Earth Guardian in West Woodlands. She asks you to find this artifact first. Once found, the other Goddesses will assist with the other artifacts. You give Miraelis the Mysterious Artifact that you found so she can have it studied for anomalies.

### Part 2: Elemental Guardians

### Part 3: The Goddess' Trials

!!! note

    This portion of the quest **must** be done solo.

#### Trial of Combat

??? info "Level considerations"

    Although this quest can be done as early as 71, it will be very tough for non-99's to complete. It's completely OK to wait until 99 before attempting these trials, but you're more than welcome to try!

- Select "What are the other trials?"
- Select "I can handle it."

!!! danger ":material-sword-cross: Combat incoming!"

- When you are ready to face the trials, select "I am ready."

!!! note ""

Before sending you to fight the summoner, the gods have designed four trials you must overcome _yourself_. The trial of combat, the trial of luck, the trial of intelligence and the trial of sacrifice. In the event you fail a trial, you can retry every real life hour.

!!! note ""

You have 10 minutes to defeat five waves of monsters:

- Hobgoblins
- Crypt Kardis
- Orc Warriors
- Gargoyles
- Slugs, Glupes, Bone Collectors

Monsters will spawn all around the arena. In order for you to proceed to the next wave, all monsters must be defeated.

- Once victorious, speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will go speak to Serendael."

!!! info ""

Miraelis is impressed with how you handled yourself in combat and states that's what they're looking for. She directs you next to the trial of luck.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Luck

- Speak to Serendael
- Select "Is there any tips to pass?"
- Select "I will try."

The trial of luck consists of 3 rounds of picking the correct door. Wrong doors will teleport you back to the beginning and right ones will allow you to progress. This trial is purely luck-based; you will have 1 minute to complete it.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    You will spawn into a hallway and must run forward until you see 3 doors spawn. Choose any door. If the door is correct, you'll see text in the communication window that says "The door opens and lets you through." If the door is incorrect, you will see "The door locks and sends you flying." If you get the first round correct, there are 5 doors on the second round and 8 doors on the third. If you get the door wrong, the door that was correct before will not be correct the second time. Every round is purely random. Just mount up and keep clicking doors until you get through.

- Upon completion, speak to Serendael
- Select "I will go speak to Theselene."

!!! info ""

Serendael compliments your luckiness and lets you know that luck is needed when facing the Summoner. She tells you to speak with Goddess Theselene to take on the trial of intelligence.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Intelligence

- Speak to Theselene
- Select "Do you have any advice?"
- Select "I understand."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of intelligence consists of an invisible maze. You must map out the maze to navigate through it. You get 5 tries before you are reset to the beginning, however it will not reset your progress in the maze. You have 8 minutes to complete the trial.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    Drop denominations of 1 gold on the ground to remember where you're going. Not every path you take will lead to the end of the maze. If you notice that the path you went down has no more choices, try a different starting point at the beginning and see where it takes you.

- With the maze solved, speak to Theselene
- Select "I will go speak to Skandara."

!!! info ""

Theselene says that shadows quake in fear of you; the sheer intelligence you behold shows. She advises you to speak with Skandara for the final trial, the trial of sacrifice.

!!! info ""

#### Trial of Sacrifice

- Speak to Skandara
- Select "What are your words of wisdom?"
- Select "I know."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of sacrifice creates an environment where you will need to show that you have what it takes to risk it all. There will be 5 waves of monsters and Zoe will be their target. You must protect Zoe throughout the trial. You have 20 minutes to complete the trial.

??? tip "Trial explanation"

    This trial starts with a little girl named Helpless Zoe in the middle of an arena. Waves of monsters will spawn and directly target Zoe. You will need to fend them off to keep Zoe from taking damage. She has a large health pool and can tank monsters for a bit.

    On the last wave, a dragon will spawn and start speaking. After about 10 seconds, the dragon will breathe a large frontal in front of him. Your need to position yourself directly in front of the dragon with Zoe behind you to shield her from the dragon's blast. This will complete the trial.

- With Zoe safe, speak to Skandara
- Select "That blast hurt..."
- Select "I will do that."

!!! info ""

Skandara is impressed, even though the hydra knocked you out; that's what a soldier is all about. Zoe is safe and the hydra took after he realized he was too weak. She congratulates you and tells you to speak with Goddess Miraelis.

!!! info ""

#### Back to Miraelis

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will be on my way there."
- Select "I'll bring a party, thank you."

!!! info ""

Miraelis shares that they have verified the location of the Summoner within the third floor of Eingren Manor. You will need the True Elemental Artifact to break the seal on the stairs. She mentions that the summoner isn't alone; there are multiple other bosses lurking around on the third floor. You will need a party to venture through there. Miraelis then hands you the True Elemental Artifact.

!!! info ""

### Part 4: Search for the Summoner

!!! warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

??? tip "Group comp!"

    If doing this with a fresh 99 party, you are going to want a balanced group of a Priest, DPS and possibly a tank. If an experienced master is coming along with you, they will likely be able to solo the dragon.

- With the True Elemental Artifact, head to Eingren Manor with a party and go upstairs to 14,1
- Select "We are ready."

??? info "Boss locations"

    The third floor of Eingren Manor is huge with two extra bosses and then the summoner himself.

    Here are the locations to the two optional bosses and the summoner:

    - Possessed Knight (11,23)
    - Hollow (145,20)
    - Summoner Kades (28,185)

- (Optional) Defeat the side bosses
- Once ready, head to Summoner Kades
- Upon encountering him, he will display some dialogue:

> You are very bold Aislings. Coming into my home... This world is mine now. Return to which you came. I have other things to tend to, Servant! Get them!

- Kades will then summon his Servant, Morroc, and escape. Morroc explains during the fight:

> Nothing will stop master from summoning them! He will rule the world with the creants! Master is going to Cthonic Remains! He will rule the world with the creants!

!!! tip

    Unless you can take a hit, do not stand in front of Morroc! He has a strong fire frontal that will do massive damage to you.

Once Morroc has been slain, a portal will open that will take you back to the entrance at Eingren Manor. The True Elemental Artifact will have been consumed during this process.

- Head back to the God's Realm through your chosen Goddess temple
- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "He said the Summoner went to the Cthonic Remains"
- Select "Ok, I will wait."
- Select "How strong should I be?"

!!! info ""

Miraelis mentions she will begin an investigation into what Morroc mentioned about the Summoner heading to the Cthonic Remains before having you go look yourself. She asks you to wait until the goddesses have more information.

!!! info ""

- Speak to Miraelis again
- Select "What are Creants?"
- Select "Why are they so powerful?"
- Select "Why didn't you stop them?"
- Select "That's why Summoner Kades is down there."
- Select "How strong should I be?"
- Select "I will try."

!!! info ""

Miraelis believes that Summoner Kades is headed to the Cthonic Remains to summon the creants. The Creants are mystical creatures that the Goddesses have spent centuries sealing away, too powerful to ever be killed. They represent four of the elements:

!!! info ""

- Lady Phoenix, who has captured the wind
- Tauren, who has captured the earth
- Shamensyth, who controls fire
- Medusa, who dominates the flow of water

!!! info ""

Shortly after the Goddesses created elements in Unora, these Creants came and used them for evil. Killing these Creants would be as difficult as killing the elements they created themselves; with the elements being a part of the goddesses themselves, they couldn't do it. Instead, one by one, they sealed the Creants away deep beneath the Cthonic Remains. It was done so long ago, the goddesses weren't sure anyone even knew about them until now. She mentions you must go down there and slay Summoner Kades for good this time, but you will need to be much stronger this time around.

!!! info ""

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need at least 25,000 vitality before facing Summoner Kades again._

### Part 5: Find the Summoner again

??? warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

    You will need a party (with a Priest!) for this part.

#### To Cthonic Remains

- (Optional) Once you have 25,000 vitality, return to Miraelis in the God's Realm and speak to her
- (Optional) She will request for you to investigate the Cthonic Remains and find the summoner
- Head to Cthonic Remains 11

??? tip "CR Coordinates"

    Here's a quick guide on where to go inside:

    - CR1 -> CR2: 74,45
    - CR2 -> CR3: 51,38
    - CR3 -> CR4: 38,64
    - CR4 -> CR5: 27,23
    - CR5 -> CR6: 4,31
    - CR6 -> CR7: 14,29
    - CR7 -> CR8: 47,53
    - CR8 -> CR9: 75,45
    - CR9 -> CR10: 60,15
    - CR10 -> CR11: 84,6

!!! danger ":material-emoticon-devil-outline: Boss room ahead!"

- Once inside, enter the broken wall at 1,39
- Select "We are ready."
- You will be teleported to the Cthonic Domain, where Summoner Kades resides

#### Second battle with the Summoner

Summoner Kades will cast magic on your party to cage you in place. He'll start muttering in another language:

!!! info ""

> Ta se deas duit teacht chun feachaint. Glacfaimid Unora le cheile, na Creants agus me fein. Is anois ar n-am! Lean mise isteach sa dorchadas. Eirigh, a chara dhil, Tauren, Eilimint an Domhain. Tar anuas go Unora, Lady Phoenix, Eilimint an Ghao... Rugadh as na lasracha, Shamensyth, Eilimint an Doi... Ri na Farraige, Medusa, Eilimint an Uisce. Teigh abhaile. Caithfidh me na triobloidi seo a mh...

If you check the yellow chat log, you'll see a translated version of what Summoner Kades is saying (I missed some of this due to the messages being too long, but here is a truncated version):

> It is nice of you to come watch. The Creants and I will take Unora together. Now is our time! Follow me into the darkness. Now is our time! Follow me into the darkness. Rise, my dear friend, Tauren. [truncated] Come down to Unora, Lady Phoenix. [truncated] Born of the flames, Shamensyth. [truncated] Queen of the Sea, Medusa. Return home. I must kill these [truncated]. My friends have returned to the world. You have been following me, it is time to perish.

!!! info ""

Summoner Kades will then turn hostile, remove your cage and start attacking your party.

- After some damage, he will portal away. Chase him into the portal
- You will arrive in Terra Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Terra Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in the Gale Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Gale Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in the Tide Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Tide Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- You will arrive in Ignis Guardian's Domain. Attack him
- After some more damage, he will summon two Ignis Guardians and run off. Defeat the guardians and follow him into the portal
- Attack Kades. He will summon one of each guardian's element in a final fight for his life. Defeat the guardians and Kades to finish the battle

Return to the God's Realm.

#### Back to the God's Realm

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "No, Kades ported them away."
- Select "We fought Summoner Kades."
- Select "He just vanished at the end."
- Select "What can I do?"
- Select "Yes Goddess Miraelis."

!!! info ""

You brief Miraelis on the fight with Summoner Kades and the Creants taking portals into Unora. Miraelis is worried and found it too soon to send you out on this journey. She asks you to continue your training and see her again once you master.

!!! info ""

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need to be a Master of your class._

### Part 6: Defeat the Dark Army
