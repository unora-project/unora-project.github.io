### Part 1: Finding the Mysterious Artifact

To start this quest, you must come across an item called a "Mysterious Artifact". This item is found randomly, but can be found  walking around in the Mileth Crypt floors. It's been reported this can be found on floors 3 and 4.

Once you have the Mysterious Artifact, to proceed, you must join a [religion](./../../../religion/overview.md). Once you've joined one:

- Speak to the goddess that you're worshipping
- Select "Mysterious Artifact"
- Select "Take me there"
- You are teleported to the God's realm
- First, speak with Goddess Miraelis
- Select "I spoke to Zephyr"
- Select "Ignatar was helped by a summoner"
- Select "The summoner disappeared once the war started"
- Select "Zephyr said he still roams Unora"
- Select "Is there something I can do?"
- Select "How do I get around the barrier?"
- Select "Where do I find the Elemental Artifacts?"
- Select "What about the other artifacts?"
- Select "Thank you Goddess"
- You can choose to stay here or chat with the other Goddesses, although they have nothing useful to say at the moment

#### Summary

Miraelis explains that the summoner that helped Ignatar is pinned up on the 3rd floor of Eingren Manor and has protected the floor with a barrier. To get around the barrier, you must assemble the True Elemental Artifact. To do this, you must collect four artifacts and bring them to the Goddesses, which, with the other Goddess's help, Miraelis would be able to assemble.

The first artifact, the Earth Artifact, is held by the Earth Guardian in West Woodlands. She asks you to find this artifact first. Once found, the other Goddesses will assist with the other artifacts. You give Miraelis the Mysterious Artifact that you found so she can have it studied for anomalies.

### Part 2: The Earth Artifact

- Head to the West Woodlands
- The Earth Guardian can be found in map 6 at coordinates 20,X

TBD.
