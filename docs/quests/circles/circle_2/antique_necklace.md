### Clue descriptions

#### Clue One

> From the shadowy corners of the room, we observed her carefully. Despite the spectral presence in the dusty manor, she showed a remarkable bravery and determination, continuing her path through the ancient halls. Zulera was indeed a force to be reckoned with.

#### Clue Two

> The true test came when she entered one of the bedrooms. As Zulera rested upon an aged cushion, we sent a ghostly whisper through the room, a sound that seemed to freeze her blood. She tried to dismiss it as a trick of her mind, but we ensured the chilling ambiance of our presence. The sudden, icy gust followed by an unearthly silence left no doubt.

#### Clue Three

> It was then that she sensed the absence of her necklace. Panic bloomed on her face as she combed through the room, scrutinizing every corner, but the necklace had vanished. As she retracted her steps, she made a realization - the necklace must have been misplaced amidst the cushion she had been seated on.

#### Clue Four

> As Zulera extended her hand towards the ORANGE cushion, we couldn't resist but intervene. The moment her fingers grazed the fabric, we sent a surge of ethereal energy through it, startling her with a shock akin to a bolt of electricity. The cushion took on a life of its own, and her scream echoed in the room as we materialized around her in spectral form. She went running!
