## Walkthrough

- Head to Undine and enter the tavern (19,77)
- Speak with Chloe and select "The Sacrifice" to start the quest
- You have several options here:
    - I'll go check it out.
    - I will slay the Goblins and Kobolds.
    - I will rescue them.
- Each option will change what you need to do next

### If you selected "I'll go check it out." ...

- Head to Astrid
- Search the area at the tips of the star. Every scouted area will award you experience. Scout _at least_ three areas (though it's worth scouting all 5 for the maximum experience) and then return to Chloe.

!!! tip

    Astrid maps draw a star across several maps. If you follow the path hugging the outside path, you'll find 45 degree angle roads that are the "tip" of the star. You'll receive a notice in your yellow chat log window when you correctly trigger the area.

- Head back to Chloe to complete the quest

### If you selected "I will slay the Goblins and Kobolds."

- Chloe explains that she will reward experience for every captor killed up to a maximum of 25 each. At a minimum, you will need to slay 10 of any type of captor to be eligible to complete the quest
- Head to Astrid
- Each monster type is a captor (Kobold, Goblin Warrior, Goblin Soldier, Goblin Guard) and has their own independent credit. For the maximum amount of experience, get 25 kills of each type of monster
- Return to Chloe to complete the quest

### If you selected "I will rescue them."

TBD.
