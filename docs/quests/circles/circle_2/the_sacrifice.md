## Walkthrough

- Head to Undine and enter the tavern (19,77)
- Speak with Chloe and select "The Sacrifice" to start the quest
- You have several options here:
    - I'll go check it out.
    - I will slay the Goblins and Kobolds.
    - I will rescue them.
- Each option will change what you need to do next

### If you selected "I'll go check it out." ...

- Head to Astrid
- Search the area at the tips of the star. Every scouted area will award you experience. Scout _at least_ three areas (though it's worth scouting all 5 for the maximum experience) and then return to Chloe.

!!! tip

    Astrid maps draw a star across several maps. If you follow the path hugging the outside path, you'll find 45 degree angle roads that are the "tip" of the star. You'll receive a notice in your yellow chat log window when you correctly trigger the area.

- Head back to Chloe to complete the quest

### If you selected "I will slay the Goblins and Kobolds."

- Chloe explains that she will reward experience for every captor killed up to a maximum of 25 each. At a minimum, you will need to slay 10 of any type of captor to be eligible to complete the quest
- Head to Astrid
- Each monster type is a captor (Kobold, Goblin Warrior, Goblin Soldier, Goblin Guard) and has their own independent credit. For the maximum amount of experience, get 25 kills of each type of monster
- Return to Chloe to complete the quest

### If you selected "I will rescue them."

!!! warning

    This quest has the potential to be _very_ time consuming. Each map in Astrid has one child that can be rescued. There is one tile on each map that has a 75% chance to trigger the child being rescued, meaning you could still walk on every tile on the map and not find the child as when you find the trigger tile, you have a 25% chance for it not to trigger.

- Select "I will."
- You tell Chloe you are going to rescue the children that were kidnapped in Astrid
- Head to Astrid
- Wander around aimlessly on any map you choose to find a child
    There is one child on each map in Astrid if you're feeling adventurous
- Return to Chloe once you've found at least one child to complete the quest
