# Porte Forest

## Requirements

- Must be between level 21-40
    - Once you're 41, you can no longer complete this quest as Porte Forest has a maximum level of 40
- A party. The areas to hunt the required items in are dangerous solo. Specifically, you will want a Priest in your party for at least the last boss

???+ tip "Watch your level!"

    If you're 40 and close to 41, press "F1" to open the Terminus menu and select "Toggle Experience Gain" > "No" to disable gaining experience. This will allow you to fully complete the quest.

???+ bug

    If you level to 41 while inside of Porte Forest, you will not be able to leave without the assistance of a GM or a passport. Be mindful of this if you're level 40 and especially during the quest turn-ins as they will level you while instead of Porte Forest, which will get you stuck.

## Rewards

- Legend mark: Saved the Daughter of Porte Forest
- Legend mark: Eased the suffering of Porte Forest
- Cosmetic: Change the color of your mount cloak to purple

## Walkthrough

### Speaking with Torbjorn

!!! note ""

You can pre-hunt or have the quest items on you ahead of time to speed up this quest. You'll need 4 Trent Roots and 5 Silver Wolf Mane Hairs for each member of the party.

!!! note ""

- Go to the Suomi Weapon Shop (11,55)
- In front of Torbjorn, say "Porte Forest". He will request to bring back 4 Trent Roots
    - Everyone in your party will need 4 Trent Roots
- Go to Porte Forest 3-R (3-C has them too)
    - From the entrance, right, up, up
- Kill Tree Demons to collect 4 Trent Roots for everyone in the party

!!! note ""

For this part, we are working ahead and collecting Silver Wolf Mane Hairs, which we will turn into Bertil. This saves some time farming them now versus having to go back to town to come right back here.

### Hunting Trees and Wolves

!!! note ""

- Head to Porte Forest 4-R
    - In 3-R, go to 27,1 to get to 4-R
- Kill Silver Wolves to collect 5 Silver Wolf Mane Hairs for everyone in the party
- Head back to Torbjorn in Suomi (11,55) and say "Porte Forest" to turn in the Trent Roots
- While still in Suomi, head to Bertil, the Suomi White Magic Master (16,86). She will request 5 Silver Wolf Mane Hairs
    - Everyone in your party will need 5 Silver Wolf Mane Hairs
    - If you followed this guide, you should already have them as we just hunted them. If not, look at the info blob above

### Finding the Pendant

- Head to Porte Forest from the main world map

??? tip "Map Explanation"

    Porte Forest is split up into three paths: "L" (Left), "C" (Center), and "R" (Right)

- He'll ask you to find a pendant in Porte Forest 4-R (11,25)
    - In 3-R, go to 27,1 to get to 4-R
- Go back to Bertil, the Suomi White Magic Master (16,86) to turn in the Silver Wolf Mane Hairs
    - This will reward you with an item named "Silver Wolf Leather"

!!! note ""

Make sure everyone in your party has the Silver Wolf Leather item in their inventory. This significantly reduces the amount of damage the boss will do to you.

!!! note ""

### Trap Room

!!! warning ":octicons-people-16: Party required!"

- Go to Isabelle in Porte Forest (21,38). She's at the entrance
- Click "Turuc Pendant" and go through the prompts
- She'll make make mention that you can use "Giant Ant Wings" to avoid the traps where the boss is
- Head back to Porte Forest 4-C
    - From the entrance, go straight up and follow the path
- Make sure your entire group is in 4-C before proceeding!
- Once in 4-C, you will want to fend off the enemies while walking with your party in a straight line to the end, dropping Giant Ant Wings in front of the leader to pad the traps. If they trigger, they hurt!

??? tip "Rogues: Detect Traps"

    Rogues can see traps with the Detect Traps skill. If you have a Rogue in your party, try having them lead. This would make dropping Giant Ant Wings unnecessary.

- Once at the peak of Porte Forest, rest up

### Trevor

!!! danger ":material-emoticon-devil-outline: Boss room ahead!"

- Someone must now use the Turuc Pendant, which will teleport you to the boss room
- Defeat the boss, Trevor
- Once defeated, speak to Rennie. She'll mention that Trevor was her pet mantis and that he kept her safe
- She'll give you a ring that you need to give to her father, which will calm him down
- You're teleported straight to her father, Lureca, in the Porte Forest Shop. Speak to him and select "Rennie" > "She gave me this ring to give to you"
- Quest complete!
