- In Loures 2 Floor Hall, take an immediate right
- Speak to Paulin to start the quest
- Select "Where can I find this flower?"
- Select "Yes, I'll help."
- Paulin is looking for a White Rose to heal the sick princess

### Obtaining the Cure

- Head to the Wilderness through whichever means you prefer

??? tip "Rose locations"

    The "right" way to complete this quest will require 2 White Roses and a Gold Rose. While you're out in the Wilderness, you can grab these ahead of time at the following coordinates:

    - 14,131 (White Rose)
    - 143,172 (White Rose)
    - 248,76 (White Rose)
    - 144,171 (Gold Rose)
    - 247,74 (Black Rose)

??? warning "The bad ending"

    Returning to Paulin with a Black Rose will alter the way this quest plays out. No particular walkthrough for the Black Rose method, but returning with a Black Rose will kill the sick child, giving you a different legend mark.
