## Walkthrough

!!! info

    To start this quest, you will need a party that consists of one of each class: Warrior, Rogue, Wizard, Priest, Monk.

### Signing the Pact

- Head to the Loures Library
- With your party present, click the bookcase at 1,13 to start the quest
- Select "Open the book"
- Click "Next"

!!! info ""

From here, each class will have their own unique dialogue and responsibilities for the ritual. The dialogue indicates you must head to the summoning room, where the Macabre Pentagram lies. Each member must stand in a specific spot on the outside of the Pentagram, which has been told to you (and can be found within this walkthrough). To start, each party member must sign a pact by entering their character name.

!!! info ""

??? note "Special note for Wizards"

    Wizards are special and have an additional responsibility the other classes don't. You must collect 2 Zombie Flesh and place them two spaces north of where you stand in the ritual. Zombie Flesh can be found on your way to House Macabre. Anyone in the party can help you collect these, but the Wizard will need them when you get to your destination.

### Starting the Ritual

- Head to House Macabre
- Walk north to the House Macabre Central Graveyard and then East to the House Macabre East Graveyard
    - Be sure to kill zombies along the way until you have 2 Zombie Flesh, which the Wizard will need for their part of the ritual
- Head to 93,12 and enter the house (Macabre Study 4-2)
- Walk on top of the broken floor boards at 1,13 to get into the Macabre Pentagram room
- From here, each class must stand in a specific position to initiate the first part of the ritual:
    - Monk: 6,11
    - Warrior: 7,7
    - Rogue: 11,6
    - Priest: 13,10
    - Wizard: 10,13

!!! tip "Class coordinates"

    Here is a copy/pastable message you can send to your party for coordinates:

        Monk 6,11; Warrior 7,7; Rogue 11,6; Priest 13,10; Wiz 10,13

- Once everyone is in place, the Wizard must drop the 2 Zombie Flesh two tiles directly north of them (10,11)
- This will trigger a pop-up with some dialogue
- Once read, everyone in the party will need to shift places _clockwise_ two times. This means that you should end up at these new coordinates:
    - Monk: 11,6
    - Warrior: 13,10
    - Rogue: 10,13
    - Priest: 6,11
    - Wizard: 7,7

!!! tip "Shifted class coordinates"

    Here is a copy/pastable message you can send to your party for the second set of coordinates:

        Monk 11,6; Warrior 13,10; Rogue 10,13; Priest 6,11; Wiz 7,7

- Once everyone is in position, this will trigger a pop-up
- Select "Listen closely"

From here, each class will receive a different message pertaining to a clue where you can find a piece of the pentagram to collect. The clue you are given is for the class that _originally_ stood in the spot prior to you shifting two spaces clockwise.

!!! tip "Who gets each clue?"

    - Monks will receive the Rogue's clue
    - Warriors will recieve the Priest's clue
    - Rogues will receive the Wizard's clue
    - Priests will recieve the Monk's clue
    - Wizards will recieve the Warrior's clue
