### Recap

What we know so far is that there's a dragon that exists in an area with bright green grass, walking trees and a stone. The last time the dragon was lured out, the person was eating Sweet Buns and used a Lionfish as a lure. When the dragon is encountered, you will want to run from it.

### Preparation

We'll need to collect these items to attract the dragon:

- Cook a Sweet Buns dish
    - To cook this dish yourself, you must first learn the recipe. There's a chance of obtaining it as a reward from completing the [Supply Loures Army](./supply_loures_army.md) quest, or getting the recipe by other means (random monster drop). Otherwise, you can ask someone to craft you one.
    - Ingredients: 15 Fruit, 5 Vegetables, 1 Flour
        - You can use Acorns on the floor as fruit
        - Vegetables can be purchased from most restaurants
        - Flour drops off of low level bosses in Mythic
- Fish for a Lionfish

### The Dragon

!!! tip

    You are going to be put up against a boss here. The dragon has huge AoE spells that reach several tiles outwards. As a ranged class, you should be okay if you can dodge, but melee may have some difficulty here without a party. I was able to solo the dragon as a 72 Wizard without any trouble.

    Once you've completed this quest, you can start here after the cooldown period has ended.

- Once you have the items, head to the Wilderness (19,17)

!!! warning

    Make sure none of your party is in the square when you start this process. Once the dragon spawns, it will charge into the square and cast a large AoE, killing anyone it hits (even level 99's)!

- While inside of the square, eat the Sweet Buns
- Drop the Lion Fish in the direct middle of the square (18,16)
- Run out of the square (you might need to run until the square is almost off screen)
- The dragon will run towards the Lionfish and consume it
- Slay the dragon
- Once killed, a Dragon Scale will be placed into your inventory

### Forging your Dragon Scale item

Each town weaponsmith (except Piet, as Gunnar had no idea of the Dragon Scale) has a different piece of equipment that they will offer to craft in exchange for your dragon's scale for a fee of 75,000 gold:

- Mileth: Dragon Scale Sword
- Abel: Dragon Scale Ring
- Rucesion: Dragon Scale Claws
- Suomi: Dragon Scale Dagger
- Undine: Dragon Scale Gauntlet

Choose the item you want to craft and visit the appropriate weaponsmith.

- Select "You have a deal!"
- Select "Yes! Forge my (item)!"

!!! bug

    There's a visual bug here where even if you have the 75,000 gold and dragon scale on you, the weaponsmith may tell you that you don't have the required items, but still take your dragon scale and gold away. This appears to just be a dialogue bug as speaking to the weaponsmith again shows the proper wait timer.

- From here, the quest is completed, but you must wait 1 real life hour for the weaponsmith to craft your dragon item
- Return to the weaponsmith after 1 real life hour to receive your item
