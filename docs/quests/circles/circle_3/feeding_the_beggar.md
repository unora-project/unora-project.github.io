??? tip "Cheap crafting"

    A cheap way to do this is to go to the Mileth Restaurant at 34,12 and buy 5 vegetables from Oona. You can pick up 10 acorns for free around Mileth and other areas; these count as fruit. For meat, you can get beef slices from Wolves.

- Once you have the ingredients, at the kitchen, walk around the table in the middle until you get the cooking pop-up and select "Dinner Plate"

!!! warning

    Cooking can fail! If you failed to make the dinner plate because fo rotten ingredients, you will need to collect more ingredients and try again

- With the dinner plate in hand, head back to the Beggar and select "I brought you a dinner plate." to complete the quest
