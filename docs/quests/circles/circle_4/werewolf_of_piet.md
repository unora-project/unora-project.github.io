## Walkthrough

!!! warning

    Before this quest will trigger the appropriate dialogue, it must be night time in game (7:00PM+).

- Head to Piet Storage (51,14)
- You will need to wait until an NPC named "Daisy" enters the room to eavesdrop on some conversation related to a werewolf being in Piet
    - This is triggered any time after 7PM in-game time

!!! bug

    Unsure if this is truly a bug or not, but in order to get the dialogue to pop up, I had to open the "Withdraw Item" section of my bank for Jilt to interrupt me and tell me about the werewolf.

- Once you've watched the conversation, Jilt will speak to you
- Select "No but I will investigate"
- Select "Ok, I will."

Jilt mentions that there's a werewolf that comes out in Piet at night, but he thinks it may be one of them. He asks you to bring a group to slay it.

!!! warning

    Before performing this next step, make sure you are in a party! If your party member has done this quest before, they will not teleport into the room with you.

- Head to the Piet Empty Room (30,12)
- You will see Toby isn't feeling too well and eventually transforms into a werewolf
- Slay the werewolf
- Toby will transform back into a human
- Speak to Toby

Toby thanks you for turning him back into a human. He's been trying to cure or control his form, but he hasn't been able to. He mentions you should go speak to Appie, the Piet Magic Shop owner. He mentions you also now have the werewolf curse.

- Exit the empty room

!!! info

    Until you complete this quest, you will now turn into a werewolf during night time.

- Head to Appie in the Piet Magic Shop (44,50) and speak to him
- Select "Werewolf Cure"
- Select "How do I control it?"
- Select "I will be careful."
- Select "I'll find the Rose of Sharon."

Appie mentions there is a rare flower deep in the Werewolf Woods located in Shinewood Forest. The flower is heavily guarded by werewolves, but the werewolves won't bother you if you look like them. He warns you to be cautious of the master werewolf, who is much more keen to your smell.

- Travel to Shinewood Forest
- Head north to Shinewood Forest 1
- Head north to Shinewood Forest 2
- Head north to Shinewood Forest 3
- Head north to Shinewood Forest 4
- Head east to Shinewood Forest 5
- Head south to Shinewood Forest 6

!!! warning

    If you are currently a werewolf entering this area, the werewolves will ignore you. If it's daylight outside and you aren't a werewolf, they will be aggressive.

- Enter the Werewolf Woods at 43,38
- Head south to Werewolf Woods 2

!!! note

    Make sure your party is close by as you will be teleported into a boss fight here!

- Walking into the area will trigger a pop-up. Select "I am ready."
- Slay the Master Werewolf
- Head to 0,10 to enter Werewolf Woods 3
- Pick up the Rose of Sharon by walking over it (7,6)
- Return to Appie at the Piet Magic Shop
- Select "Werewolf Cure"

Appie takes the flower and drops it in a bottle, swirls it around and shoves it into your face to drink it. He mentions that you still have the werewolf curse, but you can now control it.
