Narve explains that Morrigu was the ancient triple goddess. She was a Tuatha De Danaan and rumored to be the dark queen of the Faeries. She mentions at the very center of the Enchanted Garden grows a large tree and a patch of bloody flowers. Sing the Song of Morrigu, but be careful; she will claim you.
