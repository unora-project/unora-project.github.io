# The Great Divine War

_Found on a bookshelf within the Loures Castle library_

The final battle of the Great Divine War, known to the people of Unora as the Battle of Elemental Harmony, was an event of cataclysmic proportions that forever marked the world.

The skies darkened as Ignatar, God of Fire and Creation, rose, his form ablaze with untamed, radiant energy. His eyes, molten gold, burned with determination and a wild desire to reshape Unora. Standing firm by Ignatar's side, Geolith, God of Earth and Strength, embodied a fortress of resilience. His solid form gleamed with various earthen hues, a testament to his unwavering resolve and enduring nature.

Opposing them, Zephyra, Goddess of Winds and Change, took to the battlefield. She, too, was a sight to behold, her form ethereal, almost transparent, blending seamlessly with the gusting winds that rushed at her command. She embodied the tempest, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the storm, her silver hair billowing around her like wind-tossed clouds.

Aquaedon, God of Water and Dreams, chose to remain neutral, observing from the depths of his tranquil seas. His form flowed gracefully, shimmering like moonlit water, his robe shifting in color and texture like the sea, reflecting the changing tide of the battle.

Among the remaining goddesses, Skandara and Miraelis stood on opposing sides, their alliances echoing the elemental gods they supported. Theselene and Serendael held their forces back, awaiting the unfolding of destiny.

As the battle erupted, Ignatar struck first, unleashing waves of fire upon Zephyra. However, her command over the winds was strong, and she deflected his attack, the flames dissipating in her gales. Geolith, supporting Ignatar, launched massive boulders into the fray, aiming to disrupt Zephyra's defenses. But Skandara, with her warriors, shattered the earthen projectiles mid-flight.

Seeing the chaos unfold, Aquaedon felt a deep sorrow and decided to intervene. He called upon a colossal wave, intending to douse the fires of conflict and restore harmony. But in the heated chaos of the battlefield, his attempt backfired. As his enormous wave clashed with Ignatar's fire, it created an immense steam explosion, a shockwave rippling across the battlefield, hitting friend and foe alike.

Stunned by the unforeseen event, the deities staggered. Ignatar, at the epicenter, took the brunt of the explosion. The once vibrant God of Fire fell, his brilliant flames extinguished, his essence fading into smoke and embers. Aquaedon, too, was devastated by the backlash of his own wave, his form dissipating into a cloud of mist and rain.

Seeing her allies fall, Zephyra fought with renewed vigor. However, exhausted and outnumbered, she couldn't stand against Geolith's might. With a mighty blow, Geolith shattered her form, the goddess becoming nothing but a wisp of wind.

Victorious but severely weakened, Geolith turned to face the remaining goddesses. Before he could strike, Miraelis stepped forward, her heart full of sorrow for the fallen gods. She touched Geolith's rocky form, pouring all her divine power into a plea for peace. Overwhelmed by her compassion and the weariness of war, Geolith crumbled, his essence returning to the earth he once governed.

In the aftermath, Theselene, Serendael, Skandara, and Miraelis stood in silence, the battlefield quiet, a stark contrast to the chaos before. The fallen gods were no more, their essence dissolved into the elements they once commanded. The surviving goddesses took it upon themselves to maintain balance in Unora.
