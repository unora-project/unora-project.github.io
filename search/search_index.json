Purple Obtained during the Porte Forest quest. Blue Obtained during the Protect Lynith Pirate Ship quest. Red Obtained during the Challenge the Carnun quest. Black Obtained by sacrificing 1,000 of any monster part to the Dubhaim Castle - Basement Altar. You must drop monster parts, one at a time, into the middle of the altar, which will summon a monster that belonged to the monster part you dropped. Defeating the monster does not count towards your total drops; only the drop itself. This is a personal counter where you, yourself, must drop 1,000 parts. Only one of a monster can exist inside of the room at a time, so you will need to summon the monster and kill it before you can summon the same monster type again. It's best to bring several different types of parts with you, so you can drop a bunch at once, then kill everything you summoned."},{"location":"calculators/hpmp/","title":"Hpmp","text":"<p> Back to Calculators</p>"},{"location":"calculators/hpmp/#hpmp-calculator","title":"HP/MP Calculator","text":"<p>This calculator might be slightly off, and needs some fixing \ud83d\ude05 </p> <p>Calculate how much experience is needed to get to your destination base.

His eyes, molten gold, burned with determination and a wild desire to reshape Unora. Standing firm by Ignatar's side, Geolith, God of Earth and Strength, embodied a fortress of resilience. His solid form gleamed with various earthen hues, a testament to his unwavering resolve and enduring nature.</p> <p>Opposing them, Zephyra, Goddess of Winds and Change, took to the battlefield. She, too, was a sight to behold, her form ethereal, almost transparent, blending seamlessly with the gusting winds that rushed at her command. She embodied the tempest, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the storm, her silver hair billowing around her like wind-tossed clouds.</p> <p>Aquaedon, God of Water and Dreams, chose to remain neutral, observing from the depths of his tranquil seas. His form flowed gracefully, shimmering like moonlit water, his robe shifting in color and texture like the sea, reflecting the changing tide of the battle.</p> <p>Among the remaining goddesses, Skandara and Miraelis stood on opposing sides, their alliances echoing the elemental gods they supported. Theselene and Serendael held their forces back, awaiting the unfolding of destiny.</p> <p>As the battle erupted, Ignatar struck first, unleashing waves of fire upon Zephyra. However, her command over the winds was strong, and she deflected his attack, the flames dissipating in her gales. Geolith, supporting Ignatar, launched massive boulders into the fray, aiming to disrupt Zephyra's defenses. But Skandara, with her warriors, shattered the earthen projectiles mid-flight.</p> <p>Seeing the chaos unfold, Aquaedon felt a deep sorrow and decided to intervene. He called upon a colossal wave, intending to douse the fires of conflict and restore harmony. But in the heated chaos of the battlefield, his attempt backfired. As his enormous wave clashed with Ignatar's fire, it created an immense steam explosion, a shockwave rippling across the battlefield, hitting friend and foe alike.</p> <p>Stunned by the unforeseen event, the deities staggered. Ignatar, at the epicenter, took the brunt of the explosion. The once vibrant God of Fire fell, his brilliant flames extinguished, his essence fading into smoke and embers. Aquaedon, too, was devastated by the backlash of his own wave, his form dissipating into a cloud of mist and rain.</p> <p>Seeing her allies fall, Zephyra fought with renewed vigor. However, exhausted and outnumbered, she couldn't stand against Geolith's might. With a mighty blow, Geolith shattered her form, the goddess becoming nothing but a wisp of wind.</p> <p>Victorious but severely weakened, Geolith turned to face the remaining goddesses. Before he could strike, Miraelis stepped forward, her heart full of sorrow for the fallen gods. She touched Geolith's rocky form, pouring all her divine power into a plea for peace. Overwhelmed by her compassion and the weariness of war, Geolith crumbled, his essence returning to the earth he once governed.</p> <p>In the aftermath, Theselene, Serendael, Skandara, and Miraelis stood in silence, the battlefield quiet, a stark contrast to the chaos before. The fallen gods were no more, their essence dissolved into the elements they once commanded.

Killing these Creants would be as difficult as killing the elements they created themselves; with the elements being a part of the goddesses themselves, they couldn't do it. Instead, one by one, they sealed the Creants away deep beneath the Cthonic Remains. It was done so long ago, the goddesses weren't sure anyone even knew about them until now. She mentions you must go down there and slay Summoner Kades for good this time, but you will need to be much stronger this time around.</p> <p>To start the next part of the quest, you will need at least 20,000 vitality before facing Summoner Kades again.</p>"},{"location":"quests/circles/circle_1/find_the_mysterious_artifact/#part-5-find-the-summoner-again","title":"Part 5: Find the Summoner again","text":"Party required! <p>You will need a party (with a Priest!) for this part.</p>"},{"location":"quests/circles/circle_1/find_the_mysterious_artifact/#to-cthonic-remains","title":"To Cthonic Remains","text":"<ul> <li>Once you have 20,000 vitality, return to Miraelis in the God's Realm and speak to her</li> <li>She will request for you to investigate the Cthonic Remains and find the summoner</li> <li>Head to Cthonic Remains 11</li> </ul> CR Coordinates <p>Here's a quick guide on where to go inside:</p> <ul> <li>CR1 -&gt; CR2: 74,45</li> <li>CR2 -&gt; CR3: 51,38</li> <li>CR3 -&gt; CR4: 38,64</li> <li>CR4 -&gt; CR5: 27,23</li> <li>CR5 -&gt; CR6: 4,31</li> <li>CR6 -&gt; CR7: 14,29</li> <li>CR7 -&gt; CR8: 47,53</li> <li>CR8 -&gt; CR9: 75,45</li> <li>CR9 -&gt; CR10: 60,15</li> <li>CR10 -&gt; CR11: 84,6</li> </ul> <p> Boss room ahead!</p> <ul> <li>Once inside, enter the broken wall at 1,39</li> <li>Select \"We are ready.\"</li> <li>You will be teleported to the Cthonic Domain, where Summoner Kades resides</li> </ul>"},{"location":"quests/circles/circle_1/find_the_mysterious_artifact/#second-battle-with-the-summoner","title":"Second battle with the Summoner","text":"<p>Summoner Kades will cast magic on your party to cage you in place.

Do not double-click the bells until you are ready!</p> <p>There are specific spots to use the summoning bell with each spot summoning a boss of a specific class. In order to obtain your Master Dungeon skills/spells, you must defeat both summoned class bosses that are the same class as you.

Standing in them will deal massive draining damage to you. Additionally, she is very fast and will constantly switch targets. You cannot outrun her and must stand still facing her if you're targeted to reduce the amount of damage taken. This is a very healing-intensive fight - especially when a target with low HP is chosen.</p> <p>The group should try to stay close together and find safe spots away from the tornadoes in order to avoid being hit by them. It is not worth dealing damage to the tornadoes; simply run away from them.</p> <p>Lady Phoenix will frequently cast Hail of Feathers for group-wide AoE damage, which must be healed through.

Before getting started, turn group loot off for this fight. This fight drops Warmth Potions, which will be needed in case someone turns to stone.</p> <p>When the fight starts, your healer and Wizard should be positioned at the south-easternmost portion of the altar. This is to avoid the water waves that are summoned frequently throughout the fight that will likely kill them in one hit. This also gives the Wizard added visibility to the arena, which will be explained later. The tank will tank the boss at the northernmost part of the arena by the altar/candles. Melee DPS will initially be at her rear and sides.</p> <p>When the fight starts and Medusa spawns, make sure that only the tank is facing Medusa directly. All DPS classes will focus the boss. As the fight progresses, snake nests will spawn on the outsides of the altar. It is up to either 1 or 2 bashers to hunt these nests down as they will constantly summon snakes. It's primarily the Wizard's job to kill the snakes throughout the fight so they do not make their way to the altar and kill your healer. They can be dall'd to stop them from moving so you have time to kill them.</p> <p>During combat, Medusa will transition frequently between the altar and the middle of the room. While she's in the middle of the room, you should stay on the altar as she will summon geysers that deal heavy damage if you step on them. This is especially important for the people killing the snake nests.</p> <p>Snakes will occasionally drop Warmth Potions, which should be picked up and used on anyone that has turned to stone. You should call out if you have been turned to stone. A member of your party will need to loot the potion, walk next to you and physically use the potion while facing you to remove the stone effect from you.</p> <p>At a certain phase of the fight (seems like 50%?), she will teleport to the middle of the room and several tiles will start blinking light blue on the altar. The entire party has about 12~ seconds to move onto the blinking tiles.

Everyone in the group must stand on a blinking tile in order to avoid room wide damage that will one shot you otherwise.</p> <p>As Tauren gets weaker, he will start slamming his axe into the ground in front of him, dealing high damage in a 4x4 grid.

The flames to put out are not targetable and must have AoE applied to them. They deal massive damage while standing in them and if Shamensyth, or his illusions stand in them, he is healed health. The Wizard will spend almost the entire time running around the arena trying to make sure the arena is not covered in flames.</p> <p>Before starting the fight, the healer and three other DPS must stand at each pillar. Drop a coin by the pillar as this will help aid you in where the illusions will drop. The Wizard should prioritize making sure the flames are never on these coins. Once the fight starts, the coins will be despawned and the DPS will need to drop a coin in the exact spot it was before. The first coin drop is just to aid the party where they will need to drop theirs. The tank will stand around the middle of the arena, tanking Shamensyth.</p> <p>DPS will stay put at their respective pillars the entire fight. When an illusion spawns at a coin, it is up to the DPS at the pillar to quickly defeat the illusion.</p> <p>Throughout the fight, small fire elementals will spawn that must be killed. The tank will primarily be responsible for killing them. The DPS can quickly step away from their coin to come help if the fire elementals are close enough to their coin, but they must quickly return to their coin once they have been dealt with. Adds should be prioritized over the boss as if the adds get out of control, your party will surely wipe due to the amount of damage going out.</p> <p>Shamensyth will teleport to the middle of the room occasionally and blinking light blue tiles will be visible. Your party will need to quickly stand on any of the blinking tiles. You have about 12~ seconds before the cast goes off, performing a room-wide AoE that will instantly kill anyone that isn't on a safe tile.
