Black,![Black](./mounts/assets/cloaks/black.png){ width="150" },"Obtained by sacrificing 1,000 of any monster part to the [Dubhaim Castle](./hunting_grounds/areas/dubhaim_castle.md) - Basement Altar. You must drop monster parts, one at a time, into the middle of the altar, which will summon a monster that belonged to the monster part you dropped. Defeating the monster does not count towards your total drops; only the drop itself. This is a personal counter where you, yourself, must drop 1,000 parts. Only one of a monster can exist inside of the room at a time, so you will need to summon the monster and kill it before you can summon the same monster type again. It's best to bring several different types of parts with you, so you can drop a bunch at once, then kill everything you summoned."
