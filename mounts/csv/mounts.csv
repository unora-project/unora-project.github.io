Dunan,![Dunan](./mounts/assets/mounts/dunan.png){ width="150" },Very fast,"Obtained by defeating Lord Gargoyle in [Dubhaim Castle](./hunting_grounds/areas/dubhaim_castle.md) - Basement 5. There are theories on how to spawn this boss, but the most consistent method is to bring a group with a minimum of 3 people total and hang out in Basement 5. After around 30~ minutes, Lord Gargoyle will spawn. Defeating him gives someone in the party a guaranteed Dunan. If a party member already has the mount, they will not be considered when deciding who to give the mount to."
